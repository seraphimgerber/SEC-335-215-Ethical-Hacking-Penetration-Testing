## Activity 4.1 - Exploiting Cupcake

The purpose of this activity is to give you a sense of some of the steps taken to recon, assess, exploit, achieve a foothold and elevate privileges on a system.

Through previous classes, we have discovered that the target organization (SHIRE) is running a webserver that purportedly runs a status application.

### Part 1 - Active Recon 

Q: The target is cupcake.shire.org at 10.0.5.23. What can you find out about the target? Make sure to check the top 100 TCP ports to see what ports are listening. For those ports that are open, run another scan that attempts to run version detection against the service port.

A: We ran an nmap scan using the syntax *nmap -sV -p 0-100 10.0.5.23*, which allowed us to see Port 22 was running SSH with OpenSSH version 5.3 and Port 80 was running a web server with Apache httpd on CentOS version 2.2.15.

Q: You should have the versions of at least two applications.  Go ahead and hit the internet and see if your group can find:

1. Related operating system (this is easy) 
2. Release (a bit harder)
3. What did you find and how did you find it?

A: The [Apache server](https://lists.apache.org/thread/7lw0j6023cfk35fy14q2f9tbgyn6lpmj) is an older version that was released on March 6, 2010, and it runs on CentOS. AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux are community-driven options that are very similar to CentOS. The [OpenSSH service](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.3), specifically the 5.3 version, was released on October 1, 2009 and some variants that are very similar to it would be PuTTY or Dropbear SSH.
