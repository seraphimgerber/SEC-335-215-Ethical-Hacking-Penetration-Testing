# SEC-335: Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing - Fall 2025

## Course Description and Outcomes
Operating Systems and Internet-based applications are common sources of security breaches. Students will learn about the information security flaws in software systems, vulnerabilities inherent in common network services, ways to secure Internet servers and services, and increasing security awareness in organizations. Students will also learn the methodologies and tools used to probe networks for vulnerabilities and propose solutions. Hands-on activities will give the necessary background to assess security. Scenarios will provide opportunities to discuss security, ethics, and incident response.

## Learning Objectives
This course will take students through the incident handling process. Today’s organizations require skilled first responders that are properly trained in the preparation, identification, containment, eradication, and being able to take the lessons learned from those steps to prevent or minimize the impact of a similar security incident.
* Describe ways to incorporate security into the design of software systems and Web server and e-commerce applications.
* Determine the security vulnerabilities of various software tools, various Web (and other) server applications software and design mechanisms to mitigate those vulnerabilities.
* Articulate the findings of vulnerabilities in a system and how to fix the vulnerabilities.
* Describe the process for maintaining secure software and Internet server systems.
* Apply best information security practices for software systems to the specific needs of an organization.
* Select the optimal tools for implementing software systems and server-based Internet applications given project constraints.
* Document the impact and management of secure software and server systems, and the impact on the organization, for both professional peers and managers.
